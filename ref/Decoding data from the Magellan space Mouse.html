    The following gives introductory information to handling the data from the
    Magellan Spacemouse, a 6 degree of freedom input device. The version of the mouse
    used here is based upon the serial interface, communication settings are: 8 databits,
    1 stop bit, no parity, and 9600 baud. This note is not considered an exhaustive guide
    but covers most of the "useful" aspects, the rest are mostly guessable once the material
    covered here is understood.
    </p>
    
    <p align-="justify">
    All communication with the mouse is done with standard printable ascii characters.
    Communication and data terminations/separators are using either ascii character 13
    or 10, that is, carriage return or linefeed. The mouse can tell the application which
    of the buttons is pressed as well as the position and orientation from the 6 DOF puck.
    All communication with the mouse has the form of a single character that identifies
    the type of data (for example: "k" for key, "d" for position/angle data, and so on),
    this is followed by the data associated with that data type, and finally a line
    termination. All data is encoded as single nibbles, so two functions usually required
    are those that convert to and from nibbles (4 bits, so 0..15). For example, functions to encode
    and decode bytes for the Spacemosue are as follows.
    </p>
    <pre>unsigned char EncodeSpacemouse(int n)
    {     
       int codes[16] = {'0','A','B','3','D','5','6','G','H','9',':','K','&lt;','M','N','?'};
       
       if (n &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; n &lt;= 15)
          return(codes[n]);
       else  
          return('0');
    }        
    </pre>
    
    <pre>/*
        Convert characters to nibbles
    */
    int DecodeSpacemouse(char c)
    {
       int n;
    
       switch (c) { 
       case '0': n = 0; break;
       case 'A': n = 1; break;
       case 'B': n = 2; break;
       case '3': n = 3; break;
       case 'D': n = 4; break;
       case '5': n = 5; break;
       case '6': n = 6; break;
       case 'G': n = 7; break;
       case 'H': n = 8; break;
       case '9': n = 9; break;
       case ':': n = 10; break;
       case 'K': n = 11; break;
       case '&lt;': n = 12; break;
       case 'M': n = 13; break;
       case 'N': n = 14; break;
       case '?': n = 15; break;
       default: n = 0; break;
       }
      
       return(n);
    }
    </pre>
    
    <p align="justify&quot;&gt;
    Each component of the position and orientation data are returned as 4 characters.
    They are reconstituted into an integer as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;pre&gt;
    /*
       Convert string to numbers
    */
    int ConvertSpacemouse(char *c)
    {
       int n=0;
    
       n += DecodeSpacemouse(c[0]) * 4096;
       n += DecodeSpacemouse(c[1]) * 256;
       n += DecodeSpacemouse(c[2]) * 16;
       n += DecodeSpacemouse(c[3]);
       n -= 32768;
    
       return(n);
    }
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    
    &lt;p align=" justify"="">
    There are a number of responses possible from the Spacemouse, the following lists
    all that are known by the author, comments are provided next to the more useful.
    In what follows the data from the Spacemouse until the termination character is read
    into a string "s", so the first element of the string s[0] is the identifier.

    There are a number of commands that can be sent to the Spacemouse, they generally
    follow a similar format to the above. In particular there are three things one generally
    should do to initialise the device and ensure it is working OK, these are listed below.

    Note that the user may control some aspects of the device using the buttons in conjuntion
    with the "*" button. Thee will be reported and the application can choose to take action
    or not depending on the result.
